# Discord Tutorial - IT Learning Support Page
-------------------

## **An Introduction**
Welcome to a new semester in the Information Technology program here at Mizzou. Some of you might have noticed that we have integrated our support page into Discord for easier access to ask questions and to get answers.

This page is mainly used to help you navigate throughout the IT Learning Support server. If you are already confortable with Discord feel free to skip this page, and continue reading further down for specific instructions regarding our discord server.

### Some useful resources:
- [Discord Client](https://discord.com/download) - While you can use the website for discord communication, we highly recommend you to download the application to your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android) so that you can follow along and can be helped faster throughout the semester. You are more than welcome to read the [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for Discord too!

- And that is it! All you need to do is download the client to your computer/phone and follow along to gain access to the server.

## **Step 1: Join the Server**
---
After downloading the Discord Application you can sign in with an existing account or create an new account. Use this [link](https://discord.gg/9GMFbTZruk) to join and you should be greeted with... ![intro](/images/Discord_join.png "Introduction to Server")

Now you should be able to hit "Join IT Learning Support" button and you will be in the server.


## **Step 2: Navigate the Server**
---
Now that you have joined that ILS (IT Learning Support) server, here are a few quick things to point out.
![layout](/images/Server_Layout.png "Layout Page")

- <span style="color:red">*Red*</span>: This is the list of your current servers that you are in. If you are in different servers, you can naviate to each of them by simply clicking on each icon.
- <span style="color:green">*Green*</span>: This is the list of the channels that you have access to, as we continue you will have more channels to navigate between. Text channels are signified by a *#* while voice channels are with a speaker icon.
- <span style="color:brown">*Brown*</span>: This is the name of the current server and channel that you are in. In this case, you are in the IT Learning Support Server and in the 'Rules" text channel. 
- <span style="color:blue"> *Blue*</span>: By clicking on the 'member list' you can see who is online and offline.

## Step 3: **Customizing what *YOU* Want**
---
If you go back to the IT Learning Support Server, you can see that you only have access to the 'rules' text channel and the general voice channel. Read the rules and click the green check box to gain access to more channels.

Now you will see that more text channels on your channel overlay called "class-selection' and 'general'.

### Classes...
Even more, you can select which classes you want to see. Ideally it will only include the classes that you are enrolled in this semester but if you want to see other questions in other classes go for it. 

To gain access to your choice of classes, navigate to the 'class-selection' channel and read/react to the classes you want to take part in.
